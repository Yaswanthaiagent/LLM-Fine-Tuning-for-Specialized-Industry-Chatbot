# LLM-Fine-Tuning-for-Specialized-Industry-Chatbot
This project aims to build and fine-tune a specialized domain chatbot – a small but mighty LLM trained to excel in a narrow, high-value field. The project focuses on fine-tuning an open-source LLM (like Llama 3 8B or Mistral 7B) using lightweight methods like LoRA or QLoRA.
